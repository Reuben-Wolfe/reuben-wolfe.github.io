					<img src="http://dailydropcap.com/images/T-11-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" alt="T"/>his web portfolio includes examples of my work In Mrs. Chang's Web Design and Development I class. <br> It also includes my reflection (below) on what I learned in each unit of the course.
				</p>

				<br>
				<br>

						<h2>Unit 2</h2>
						

					<p class="temp"> In this unit I learned a lot about html and how to code it. <br> I lerned a lot about its history and who created it. <br> Over all this has been good in the development of my web development career. </P>
						
						<h2>Unit 3</h2>

					<p class="temp">In this unit there was a lot to be learned but it fun learning it. <br> This really helped not develop further my career as a web designer. <br> The css might not be very fun to learn (or code), but it pays off. <br> The css allows a web designer to have their pages to look the way that they want it. <br> Over all I enjoyed working on coding the css.</P>

						<h2>Unit 4</h2>

					<p class="temp"> This section was fun to learn and practice. <br> Though I knew most of the designing process, the coding was really fun exercise as a skill. <br> There was a lot of coding that I hadn't learned that was implemented in this lesson. <br> Over all I liked this lesson a lot as it included skills that I had prevously learned.</P>

						<h2>Unit 5</h2>

					<p class="temp"> This was a fun unit to learn. I got to make a clock and style it! <br> I learned a lot of code, as it protaned to javascript. <br> It was a frustrating yet fun expirence.</P>

						<h2>Unit 6</h2>

					<p class="temp"> This mission was extremely important to me and everyone as a web designer. <br> This allowed me to see if anything was wrong with my code. <br> If there was anything wrong with my code then I'll be able to find what it is wrong and fix it. <br> The user testing allowed me to see what could use improvments and what I can change about it to make it better. </P>

						<h2>Unit 7</h2>

					<p class="temp">This section will be completed soon</P>
